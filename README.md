## üí° Solution: MARG Unified GPS Platform


MARG is a unified GPS platform transforming government logistics with real-time tracking, predictive analytics, and seamless data integration, enabling smarter, more transparent operations. It offers multiple features like:

- **Smart Geofence Engine**
- **Historical Trail Playback**
- **Role-Based Access Control**
- **Bulk & Smart Utilities**
- **Smart Alerts**
- **Advanced Dashboards**
- **Comprehensive Reports & Export**
- **Email Notifications & Alerts**

## üìù Project Overview

This project is a full-stack solution designed for real-time vehicle tracking, alert management, and logistics monitoring. It consists of:

- **Backend**: A Node.js/TypeScript API server that handles GPS data ingestion, alert processing (such as geofence, overspeeding, stoppage, and more), user and entity management, and database operations. It supports real-time data processing and provides RESTful APIs for the frontend.
- **Frontend**: A modern React/TypeScript web application (built with Vite and styled using Tailwind CSS) that provides dashboards, live tracking, alert visualization, and user management interfaces for logistics and fleet operations.

The system is designed for scalability, modularity, and ease of deployment, making it suitable for logistics companies, fleet operators, or any scenario requiring live vehicle monitoring and alerting.
